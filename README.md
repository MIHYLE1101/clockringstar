My personal place to record anything :)


T his is my personal place.

I'm not good at english, same as many ground of studies. Frankly speaking, I am well aware, the english word on this pages are also likely to grammatically messed up and wrong.

But I'm on the way to be better.

One day, in the future, I finally accomplish some goals in knowledge, languages and anything in this pages.


I wish, this'll be a successful first step of my future history.


Have a good luck.
